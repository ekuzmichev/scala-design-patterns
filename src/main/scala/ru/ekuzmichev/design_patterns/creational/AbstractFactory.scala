// The purpose is the same as all factory design patternsâ€”to encapsulate the object creation logic
// and hide it from the user. The difference is how it is implemented.
//
//The abstract factory design pattern relies on object composition in contrast to inheritance,
// which is used by the factory method. Here, we have a separate object, which provides
// an interface to create instances of the classes we need.

// What it is not so good for?
//
// It could be problematic if the objects and methods we are using (SimpleConnection, in our case) change signatures.
// In some cases, this pattern could also complicate our code unnecessarily and make it unreadable and hard to follow.
