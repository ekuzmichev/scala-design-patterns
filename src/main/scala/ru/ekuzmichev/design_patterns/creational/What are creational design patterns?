Creational design patterns, as the name suggests, deal with object creation.
In some cases, creating objects in a program could involve some extra complexities,
and creational design patterns hide these complexities in order to make the use
of software components easier. The object creation complexity could be caused by any of the following:

- The number of initialization parameters
- Required validation
- The complexity of acquiring the required parameters
- The preceding list could possibly be expanded even more and in many cases,
    these factors are present not just individually, but in combinations.
