Monoids

A monoid is a purely algebraic structure, which means that it is defined only by its algebra.
All monoids must conform to the so-called monoid laws.

Algebraic: It is defined only by its algebra, for example, the operations it supports and the laws it conforms to.

A monoid is a type with an associative binary operation over it, which also has an identity element.

Monoid laws:

- A monoid contains a T type.
- A monoid contains one associative binary operation.
    This means that for any x, y, and z of the T type, the following is true:
    op(op(x, y), z) == op(x, op(y, z)).
- A structure must have an identity elementâ€”zero.
    This element is characterized by the fact that the previous operation
    will always return the other element
    op(x, zero) == x and op(zero, x) == x.

With the use of monoids, we can easily facilitate parallel computation and build complex calculations from small pieces.
