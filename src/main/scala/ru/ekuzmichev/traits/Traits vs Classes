Use classes:

When a behavior is not going to be reused at all or in multiple places
When you plan to use your Scala code from another language, for example,
    if you are building a library that could be used in Java

Use traits:

When a behavior is going to be reused in multiple unrelated classes.
When you want to define interfaces and want to use them outside Scala,
    for example, Java. The reason is that the traits that do not have
    any implementations are compiled similar to interfaces.
